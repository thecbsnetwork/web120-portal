                <p>Rebecca is a mainstay of the Seattle theatre community and The Stay-Up Late Show has been in production for 10 years. For every performance, there is always a guaranteed audience built in just comprised of friends of the show who aren't particular about who exactly is performing and just want to enjoy the show.</p>

                <p><strong>Too many paths to get to one place</strong></p>
                <p>Social media, especially Facebook, creates a double-sided dilemma: not everyone uses Facebook and those who do are inundated with event invitations. It's easy to get lost in the shuffle. Ticket vendors include a search feature but if audiences don't know the name of the show, they're not likely to stumble upon a site.<br /><br />Friends want to be able to promote Rebecca and how much they enjoy the show. They want to be able to show support in various ways: sharing the site with others, financial support through purchasing tickets and merchandise, and reminiscing about previous performances.</p>

                <p><strong>Getting lost in the shuffle</strong></p>
                <p>Similar to the same problems faced by friends of the show, Facebook makes it incredibly hard to see events in a clear fashion and in the theatre community, people are inundated with invitations, especially when there is a strong cross-over of performers who are constantly working.<br /><br />Online event calendars also are particular about how they want to find information. Facebook is not the end-all be-all so having a strong website makes it easier to get noticed publicly.</p>
